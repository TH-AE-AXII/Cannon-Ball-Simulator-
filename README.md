# Cannonball Simulation in Processing

This project simulates a simple physics-based cannonball bouncing within a 2D canvas. It demonstrates basic principles of motion and collision, including gravity and boundary interactions.

## Overview

The simulation launches a ball with an initial velocity at a certain angle, and it is subjected to gravitational acceleration. The ball bounces off the edges of the canvas with a reversal in velocity, giving a visual representation of elastic collision with boundaries.

## Features

- **Gravity Simulation**: The ball accelerates downward due to a simulated gravitational force.
- **Elastic Collisions**: The ball bounces off canvas edges with a reversed velocity, simulating elastic collision.
- **Dynamic Scaling**: The canvas scales to fit the screen, and the ball adjusts accordingly.
